Tools made for my GEOL 496: Climate Change course along with some explanations of what we see going on in some investigations.

## Precipitation and Snowfall in the San Juans (Crested Butte)

## Run Off in the San Juans (Crested Butte)
### Data Collection
### Results

## Proxy Data
### Run Off
#### Can we use run off data over the same time interval to measure *precipitation* by proxy in the Crested Butte Basin?
