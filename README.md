## Runoff in the San Juans (Crested Butte)
### Data Collection

## Runoff as a Proxy
### Can we use run off data over the same time interval to measure *precipitation* by proxy in the Crested Butte Basin?

### Discussion
#### Why do we see such low correlation between Snowfall/Precipitation and measured Runoff?
The idea that rain and snow melt flow downhill (as opposed to uphill) is commonly accepted [source required]. With this, we would expect to see high correlations between the measured precipitation and snowfall and overall runoff downstream. **Why do we see low correlation?** To start off, let's look at our collection sites. The two collection sites are shown below in a map with Crested Butte labelled in blue and Almont in red.

Our first issue could show up from the geographic orientation of the two sites. Notice there is a river flowing from Crested Butte to Almont (that is the East River) and it joins with the Taylor River at Almont. It's possible that the runoff measurements include the runoff in the Taylor River. Further, the precipitation and snowfall measurements in Crested Butte may not represent the measurements of the surrounding areas, like those feeding the Taylor River.  

In regards to the first possibility, there isn't anything I've seen in the data or on USGS's website that indicates from which river this site collects data.  

For the second possibility, I don't have any answers at the moment. I'm not a meteorologist by any means, so I don't know if the local geographic features surrounding the Taylor would lead to different snow/precipitation patterns than Crested Butte (or vice versa).
